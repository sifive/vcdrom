# This script will build and install vcdrom, vcdParse, and http-server-relay into a developement 
# environment.  For Linux and MacOS you can simply run the script as described below.
#
# For Windows you need to run this script under WSL2 Ubuntu.  To make this work you need
# to install the mingw-w64 build environment once:
#
# sudo apt install mingw-w64
#
# The script will detect that you are in a WSL environment and build the Windows execuables for vcdParse
#
# This script require two environment variables be defined:
#
# FS_WS is the path to the workspace you are using for the FS AUT (application under test).
# FS_ROOTDIR is the path the parent folder of your dev-root/SiFive folder.
#
# For instance:
#
# WSL2 Ubuntu (you can put this in ~/.bashrc):
#    FS_WS=/mnt/c/eclipse/eclipse-2022.03-rcp/runtime-freedom-studio
#    FS_ROOTDIR=/mnt/c/dev-root
#
# Ubuntu (you can put this in ~/.bashrc):
#    export FS_WS=/home/kevinm/sifive/ws-multitap
#    export FS_ROOTDIR=/home/kevinm/dev-root
#
# MacOS (you can put this in ~/.zprofile):
#    export FS_WS=/Users/kevin/fs-dev-x86
#    export FS_ROOTDIR=/Users/kevin/dev-root
#
# The FS_WS path allows the webapp to be installed to AUT workspace and be used without having to 
# restart Freedom Studio
#
# RUNNING THE SCRIPT
#
# If you run the script with no parameters only the vcdrom webapp will be built and installed.  
# This is great if you are working on webapp code and builds faster than doing everything
#
# Options to the script:
#
#   -v build and install vcdrom
#   -s build and install http-server-relay
#   -p build and install vcdparse
#   -a build and install everything
